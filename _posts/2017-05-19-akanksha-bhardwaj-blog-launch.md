Well, every living being on planet blue-green takes out time to communicate using signals ,gestures ,words. Humans being powerful
use words, to address others and oneself. Writing letters, diaries, to-dos and emails (stretched beyond 4-5 sentences) 
everyday we waste keystrokes, our thoughts and expressions remain scattered in message threads while we can preserve them. 
A blog is such a place where you get to keep your words, addressed to possibly anyone even inanimate objects(your book shelf), or none at all. 


Guess what, a blog [post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) helped me set this site up in less 
than an hour with help of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and now I can write plain text posts 
in markdown and they will get converted to HTML.

Create yours today and start spilling words!
